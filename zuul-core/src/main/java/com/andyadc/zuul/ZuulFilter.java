 * Base abstract class for ZuulFilters. The base class defines abstract methods to define:
 * filterType() - to classify a filter by type. Standard types in Zuul are "pre" for pre-routing filtering,
 * "route" for routing to an origin, "post" for post-routing filters, "error" for error handling.
 * We also support a "static" type for static responses see  StaticResponseFilter.
 * Any filterType made be created or added and run by calling FilterProcessor.runFilters(type)
 * <p/>
 * filterOrder() must also be defined for a filter. Filters may have the same  filterOrder if precedence is not
 * important for a filter. filterOrders do not need to be sequential.
 * <p/>
 * ZuulFilters may be disabled using Archius Properties.
 * <p/>
 * By default ZuulFilters are static; they don't carry state. This may be overridden by overriding the isStaticFilter() property to false
